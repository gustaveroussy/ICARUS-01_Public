ICARUS BREAST01 [NCT04965766](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04965766) and ICARUS LUNG01
[NCT04940325](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04940325) are two multicentric phase II French clinical trials
resulting from the collaboration between Gustave Roussy and Daiichi Sankyo.
The BREAST01 trial aims at assessing the activity of *patritumab deruxtecan* (U3-1402; targets HER3) in advanced breast
cancers, while the LUNG01 trials investigates *datopotamab deruxtecan* (DS-1062a; targets TROP2)
in advanced or non-resectable non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).
